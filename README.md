PDB-Demos
=========

This is a public repository for Oracle Multitenant related SQL. When uploading code, please provide a README that describes the code configuration, deployment and execution. One of the core value propositions of Oracle Multitenant is the data mobility/agility through database unplug/plug operations. This lends itself well to Multitenant related demos provisioned within a Pluggable Database (PDB). Any uploaded PDB demo should inlcude a manifest (.xml) and required datafiles in addition to any code and README for the demo so that the PDB can easily be plugged in to the users hosting Container database (CDB).

Please provide feedback as necessary.

Enjoy!
